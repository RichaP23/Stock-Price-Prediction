# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock prices using Python and machine learning techniques. The objective is to understand historical trends, apply regression-based forecasting models, and eventually extend to time series forecasting using ARIMA.

## 📂 Project Overview

In this project, I:
- Collected and explored stock market data
- Performed data preprocessing and visualization
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict closing stock prices
- Planned future improvements using ARIMA for time series forecasting

> 🔍 **Goal:** Leverage stock price prediction as a use-case to understand forecasting methods that are widely applicable in business analytics, including sales and revenue forecasting.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for model building)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Key Components

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 📁 Data Preprocessing | Cleaned missing values, formatted data, and engineered features |
| 📈 Data Visualization | Analyzed trends and correlations using plots |
| 🔮 Model Building | Used Linear Regression to predict closing stock prices |
| 📉 Evaluation | Evaluated model performance using RMSE & MAE |
| 🧠 Future Scope | Implement ARIMA for time series forecasting |

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implement ARIMA model for improved time series forecasting  
- Add technical indicators like Moving Average, RSI, MACD  
- Create interactive dashboards using Plotly/Streamlit  
- Compare multiple forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM)
